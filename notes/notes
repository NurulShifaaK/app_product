STEP 4:to start the server npm start
 NOTE: TO AVOID RESTART AGAIN AND AGAIN TO UPDATE THE CODE IN NODE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD
 npm i nodemon -D DEVELOPER DEPENCIES YOU DONT HAVE TO RESTART AGAIN AND AGAIN
STEP 5:INSTALL npm i dotenv AND CREATE FOLDER CALLLED CONFIG and CREATE FILE CALLED config.env.

TO KEEP A CLEAN CODE CREATE SEPARATE FOLDER AND FILES FOR ROUTING ANFD CONTROLLER
SETP 6:CREATE FOLDER CALLED CONTROLLER AND CREATE FILE CALLED productController.js
